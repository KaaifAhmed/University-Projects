RULES FOR BEING HUMAN
by Cherie Carter-Scott (narrative adaptation)
============================================================

Introduction
------------
You may not remember it, but when you were born, you arrived with a set of quiet instructions--guidelines not handed to you, but built within you. These are not rules in the strict sense, but truths you rediscover as life unfolds.

This is not a manual, but a mirror. And if you understand these rules, life might still be messy--but it will make more sense.

Chapter 1: You Will Receive a Body
----------------------------------
It may be tall, short, strong, fragile, fair, dark, whole, or marked. But it is yours.
This body will carry your joys, your mistakes, your tiredness, and your hopes. You may learn to love it, or you may spend a lifetime fighting it--but it will always be yours.

It is not a mistake. It is your home.

Chapter 2: You Will Learn Lessons
---------------------------------
You are enrolled in an informal school called life. Here, every day is a classroom, and every person is a teacher--even the ones who hurt you, even the ones you don't understand.

Sometimes, you'll think you've graduated. Then something small will humble you again. That's okay. The school has no end, only depth.

Chapter 3: There Are No Mistakes -- Only Lessons
------------------------------------------------
Failure is not a full stop. It's a comma.
Every error, heartbreak, or wrong turn is not punishment -- it is instruction. You are not here to be perfect. You are here to learn.

Chapter 4: A Lesson Will Repeat Until It Is Learned
---------------------------------------------------
You will find yourself in familiar situations--again and again.
You will wonder: Why does this always happen to me?
And then you'll realize: Life is patient. It keeps giving you the same lesson in different disguises, until you stop reacting and start listening.

Chapter 5: Learning Does Not End
--------------------------------
Graduation never comes. Not in this school.
When you feel you know enough, life may nudge you gently--or shake you hard--to remind you: there is always more. Wisdom is not a destination. It is a lifelong posture of humility.

Chapter 6: "There" Is No Better Than "Here"
-------------------------------------------
You'll chase a job, a city, a partner, a dream--thinking that's when life will begin.
But when you get there, "there" becomes "here," and you'll hunger for the next "there."
Peace is not in movement. It's in presence.

Chapter 7: Others Are Mirrors
-----------------------------
Every person you admire reflects your highest self.
Every person you dislike reflects a part you've yet to understand.
You'll find pieces of yourself in every relationship--especially the hard ones.

Chapter 8: What You Make of Life Is Up to You
---------------------------------------------
You are not powerless. You may not control what happens to you, but you choose your response. Every day, you build your life through those choices.
Victimhood is real, but it is not your identity. You are the author of the next page.

Chapter 9: The Answers Lie Inside You
-------------------------------------
You'll look to parents, mentors, books, and beliefs--and all may guide you.
But eventually, you must sit quietly, close your eyes, and listen inward.
The voice you've ignored is wiser than you think.
Trust it. It was there from the beginning.

Epilogue
--------
These rules are not new. They are not mine.
They belong to all of us, and none of us.
You already knew them when you were a child.
This book is just a gentle reminder.
